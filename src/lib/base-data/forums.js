Remote working will no longer be the default arrangement except where a formal reasonable adjustment or other exceptional business need has been agreed in advance with your line manager and HR.\n\nPlease note:\n- Normal office hours should be adhered to unless otherwise agreed with your manager.\n- Desk booking is available via MakeIToday > Facilities > Desk Booking.\n- If you believe you require a reasonable adjustment or have exceptional circumstances, speak to your line manager and HR immediately so this can be considered.\n\nNon-compliance with this requirement will be treated seriously and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of your employment in accordance with our disciplinary procedure.\n\nWe appreciate everyone’s co-operation during this change. If you have any questions, please contact HR.\n\nKind regards,\nKaren (HR Office)",
