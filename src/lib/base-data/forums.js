        "Dear all,\n\nFollowing a recent review and a decision by Management, we will be moving to a **full-time on-site working model** with effect from **Monday 1 December 2025**.\n\nFrom that date, all staff members are required to be on-site **five days per week**. Remote working will no longer be the default arrangement except where a formal reasonable adjustment or other exceptional business need has been agreed in advance with your line manager and HR.\n\nPlease note:\n- Normal office hours should be adhered to unless otherwise agreed with your manager.\n- Desk booking is available via MakeIToday > Facilities > Desk Booking.\n- If you believe you require a reasonable adjustment or have exceptional circumstances, speak to your line manager and HR immediately so this can be considered.\n\nNon-compliance with this requirement will be treated seriously and may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of your employment in accordance with our disciplinary procedure.\n\nWe appreciate everyoneâs co-operation during this change. If you have any questions, please contact HR.\n\nKind regards,\nKaren (HR Office)",
