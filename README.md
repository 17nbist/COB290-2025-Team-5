# Conventions

⚠️ This is a working document and is subject to evolution.

To ensure that all code meets our quality standards, please follow the following conventions:
* Variables should be lower camel case.
  * For example: `newVariable`.
  * Snake case (`snake_case` is not permitted).
* All code **must** be reviewed by at least one other person before it is merged.
  * Pull requests that require multiple features will require multiple reviewers.
  * You **must NOT** blindly approve code without actually reading it and understanding how the code works with other parts of the system.
